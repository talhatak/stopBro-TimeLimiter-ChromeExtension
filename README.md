# StopBro - TimeLimiter

Stop Bro is a simple but powerful Chrome extension that helps you stay focused online. Set a time limit for any distracting website — and when your time's up, Stop Bro steps in.

## 🛑 How it works:
- Set a Time Limit: Choose how long you can stay on a specific site.

- "Stop Bro" Popup: Once your limit is reached, a fullscreen popup appears with a blurred background telling you to "Stop bro."

- Continue with Delay: If you insist on staying, you must click "Continue to site", triggering a 10-second "Are you sure bro?" countdown.

- Track Extra Time: The extension records how much extra time you spend after the limit.

## ✨ Features
- Customizable time limits for different websites.

- Simple and clean interface.

- Helps you become more mindful of your time online.
